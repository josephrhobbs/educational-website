Hello, world!  We're putting a lot of information here because I'm curious to see what happens when the line overflows and also I was hoping to see the indent properties and I know this is a run-on sentence but it's okay because I'll be removing it shortly.

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are

\(x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\)
