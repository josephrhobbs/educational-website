Hello, world!  We're putting a lot of information here because I'm curious to see what happens when the line overflows and also I was hoping to see the indent properties and I know this is a run-on sentence but it's okay because I'll be removing it shortly.  You can go to [Google](https://google.com/) also and research things if you want (this is just a hyperlink example).

When \( a \ne 0 \), there are two solutions to \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) and they are

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} . \]
