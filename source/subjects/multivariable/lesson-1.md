# Lesson 1: More Variables

~

Single-variable calculus can be an extremely powerful tool.  But simple human experience exposes to us its fundamental limitation... it can only tell us about how things change with respect to one variable.  The universe has lots of variables, doesn't it?  For example, space has three dimensions, so each of those can contribute a variable.  Time contributes a fourth, and we've already left the realm of single-variable calculus far behind.
